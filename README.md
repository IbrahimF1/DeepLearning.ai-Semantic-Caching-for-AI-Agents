# Semantic Caching for AI Agents

## Course Overview
The course, instructed by **Tyler Hutcherson** (Applied AI Engineering Lead) and **Iliya Zhechev** (Senior Research Engineer at Redis), combines practical exercises with foundational concepts. Participants build a semantic cache using Redis’ open source tools and explore how it can detect when differently phrased questions, such as *“How do I get a refund?”* and *“I want my money back,”* share the same meaning.

## Key Learnings
- Learned how semantic caching reduces **inference cost and latency** across repeated queries.  
- Gained experience evaluating **cache performance metrics**, including hit rate, precision, recall, and latency.  
- Applied techniques like **cross-encoders**, **LLM validation**, and **fuzzy matching** to improve cache accuracy.  
- Implemented and integrated a **semantic cache** to minimize redundant API calls and increase response speed as the system warmed up.
